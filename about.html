				<p>My name is Joshua Wood and I am a graduate of James Madison University. I majored in Integrated Science and Technology, with concentrations in Business and Manufacturing and Engineering. I currently work in Tysons Corner with a company called ImmixGroup, running the government business pipeline of HP Enterprise Security Products. With exposure to programming in college, I turned into a hobbyist a little over a year ago. Working on the Odin Project, I started getting familiar with utilizing Developer Tools, Command Line, and building sites incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This led me to joining George Washington University's Coding BootCamp, desiring more structure, intensity, and career assistance, and I cannot wait to see where this leads me!</p>

				<p>Enough about the boring stuff though. While I may not be the most interesting man in the world (though I do love beer), I do have a non-professional side so let's delve into a little bit of that. I have been playing electric guitar on and off for about 7 years. I 'specialize' in the metal genre (everything from Metallica and Megadeth to Avenged Sevenfold to Job for a Cowboy). Another 'fun' fact about me is that I spent nearly two months in Shanghai working for a Dutch electronics company. While the culture shock was mind-blowing, I had a fantastic time, the food was delicious, and I spent my last weekend touring Beijing and got to see the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, among others. Don't be shy, feel free to reach out and connect!</p>
