# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Using a simple HTML and CSS / Bootstrap setup, I have created a website for myself to showcase projects that I have been working on.
This is a work in progress, as I have constantly been working on various projects. The site consists of a homepage, a portfolio page 
displaying my work, and a page with my contact information.
